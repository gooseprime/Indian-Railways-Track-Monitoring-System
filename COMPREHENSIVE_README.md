## Overview

The Indian Railways Integrated Track Monitoring System (ITMS) is a comprehensive solution designed to monitor, analyze, and visualize railway track conditions in real-time. This system combines advanced sensor technology, data processing algorithms, and an intuitive user interface to provide actionable insights for railway maintenance teams.

By continuously monitoring critical track parameters such as gauge, alignment, twist, and cross-level, ITMS helps identify potential issues before they lead to safety hazards or service disruptions. The system also incorporates visual inspection through synchronized video footage, allowing for detailed examination of track segments flagged for attention.

This prototype demonstrates the core functionality of the ITMS, providing a foundation that can be expanded into a full-scale deployment across the Indian Railways network.

## Technical Details

### Track Parameter Analysis

#### Gauge Deviation Calculation

The gauge deviation is calculated as the difference between the measured gauge and the nominal gauge (typically 1435mm for standard gauge):

```python
gauge_deviation = measured_gauge - NOMINAL_GAUGE
```

Deviations beyond Â±5mm are flagged for attention.

#### Alignment Error

Alignment error is calculated from the left and right rail measurements:

```python
alignment_total = sqrt(alignment_left^2 + alignment_right^2)
```

Values exceeding 10mm are considered problematic.

#### Twist Calculation

Twist is measured as the rate of change of cross level over a specified distance. Values over 5mm/m require attention.

### Anomaly Detection

The system uses threshold-based anomaly detection for each parameter:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Parameter Measurement] --> B{Exceeds Threshold?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Flag as Anomaly]
    B -->|No| D[Mark as Normal]
    C --> E[Determine Severity]
    E --> F[Generate Alert]
    
    style B fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ffaaaa,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#ff8888,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Thresholds are based on industry standards:

| Parameter | Alert Limit | Intervention Limit | Immediate Action Limit |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Gauge Deviation | Â±3 mm | Â±5 mm | Â±10 mm |
| Alignment | 8 mm | 10 mm | 16 mm |
| Twist | 3 mm/m | 5 mm/m | 7 mm/m |
| Cross Level | 5 mm | 7 mm | 12 mm |
| Vertical Acceleration | 0.35g | 0.5g | 0.7g |
| Lateral Acceleration | 0.25g | 0.35g | 0.5g |

### Video Synchronization

Video synchronization is achieved through GPS coordinates and distance measurements:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[GPS Coordinates] --> C[Location Matching]
    B[Distance Measurement] --> C
    D[Video Timestamp] --> E[Frame Selection]
    C --> E
    E --> F[Display Synchronized Frame]
    
    style C fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Each video frame is tagged with:
- GPS coordinates
- Distance from reference point
- Timestamp

This allows for precise matching between parameter readings and video frames.
